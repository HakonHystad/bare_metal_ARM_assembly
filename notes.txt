These notes are stuff I come accross when doing research. They are not original research just a gathering of others.

The GPU is a general purpose processor which share the resources with the main processor. It boots first and reads the SD card and loads kernel.img into RAM starting at 0x8000.

There are some shared memory issues between the GPU and CPU, needed to define the memory sections explicitly to keep frameBuffer within certain memory


PS/2 interface:

- Open collector data and clock (idle both is high), falling edge transmission (sample >5 <25us)
- Kbd generates clock (10-16.7kHz, 30-50us)
- Packet: startbit(0), 8 data bits lsb, odd parity, stop bit (1),

GPIO interrupts:
GPIO pin:           4    17   30   31   47
gpio_irq[0] (49)    Y    Y    Y    Y    N
gpio_irq[1] (50)    N    N    Y    Y    N
gpio_irq[2] (51)    N    N    N    N    Y
gpio_irq[3] (52)    Y    Y    Y    Y    Y

gpio_irq[0] covers all pins exposed on the pi
